Hardware description:
	Attiny45 with I2C (using USI) for communication with core
	Uses 74164 & 74165 standard logic chips for input from buttons (w/ hardware debouncing) 
	and for output to 7-segment display

Software description:

	Writing always sets 7-segment state. Reading always sends buttons state

Joystick recieves:
	Number for 7-segment - 1 byte

Joystick sends:
	Buttons state - 1 byte

7-segment number byte format:
	
	xxxyzzzz

	xxx - reserved (actually not used) (set to 0)
	
	y - dot state (1 is on)
	
	zzzz - number to display (displays hex numbers)

Button state byte format:

	xxyyyyyy

	xx - reserved (actually not used) (set to 0)
